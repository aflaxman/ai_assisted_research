# Conventions and notes

## Naming conventions
- **Registry file:** the cancer-registry-like dataset (previously referenced as `df_2` in notebooks).
- **Finder file A:** the larger finder dataset (previously `df_1a`).
- **Finder file B:** the smaller finder dataset (previously `df_1b`).

We will use the registry/finder terminology throughout the data note and any accompanying documentation to avoid confusion.
