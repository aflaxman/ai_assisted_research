# AI-Assisted Research Project

This repository contains notes and experiments for AI-assisted open source development work.

## Structure

Use subdirectories for each research project, to keep things separated, e.g.

- `mpld3_notes/` - Development environment and PR testing for mpld3/mplexporter

## Environment

I would like to keep the environments easy to create and isolated, e.g. for mpld3_notes I will be

- Running on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Use `python -P` to avoid path shadowing issues when working inside cloned repos
- Browser files open via `explorer.exe` on WSL


## Conventions

- Use `uv` for Python package management
- Commit messages include the Claude Code attribution footer

Also for mpld3_notes

- Test scripts follow the pattern `test_pr<NUMBER>_<description>.py`

## Technical Blog Post Guidelines

When writing technical blog posts for healthyalgorithms.com:

### Project Structure

1. **Create a new subdirectory** for each blog post (e.g., `simple_fuzzy_checker_application/`)
2. **Use `uv` to set up a Python environment** in each subdirectory for isolated dependencies
3. **Put the blog draft in `README.md`** in the subdirectory

### Content Structure

1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on clarity over complexity
2. **Start with a hook** - Begin with a minimal, concrete code example that demonstrates the core topic
3. **Include a TL;DR section** - Provide quick takeaways at the beginning
4. **Include a graphic** - Add a visualization (animation, diagram, or plot) to illustrate the concept
5. **Provide runnable code** - Make the code accessible via:
   - Colab notebook (add badge: `[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](link)`)
   - Binder notebook
   - Self-contained scripts
6. **Separate concerns** - Keep simulation/implementation code separate from test code
7. **Link to specific code** - Reference code with pattern `file_path:line_number` or GitHub permalink

### File Organization

Each blog post directory should include:
- `README.md` - The blog post content
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for `uv`
- Implementation files (e.g., `simulation.py`)
- Test files (e.g., `test_simulation.py`)
- Jupyter notebook (e.g., `tutorial.ipynb`)

### Writing Style & Tone

Based on healthyalgorithms.com established voice:

1. **Accessible yet technical** - Balance rigor with conversational explanations
2. **Use first person** - Write with "I" to create personal connection
3. **Pragmatic positioning** - Frame tools/methods as useful rather than revolutionary
4. **Metaphorical headers** - Use engaging section titles (e.g., "The Problem:", "An Answer:")
5. **Question-driven narrative** - Open with a fundamental challenge readers face
6. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build to advanced applications

### Post Structure Pattern

Follow this proven narrative arc:

1. **Visual hook** - Start with an animation, graphic, or minimal code example
2. **TL;DR section** - What readers will learn, get, and the core approach
3. **Problem statement** - Articulate the fundamental challenge
4. **Solution introduction** - Present the method/tool/approach
5. **Concrete example** - Walk through a specific, complete implementation
6. **Pedagogical elements**:
   - Code snippets with explanations
   - File-by-file breakdowns
   - Links to GitHub permalinks for code context
7. **Adaptation guidance** - "How to use this in your work"
8. **Challenges/Exercises** - Engage readers beyond passive consumption
9. **Further reading** - External resources and references

### Interactive Elements

- **Colab/Binder badges** - Make code immediately runnable
- **Animated visualizations** - GIFs showing the concept in action
- **External links** - Papers, GitHub repos, related tools
- **Challenge sections** - Prompt readers to extend or experiment

### Prose Style: Strunk and White Principles

Apply these timeless writing principles for clarity and impact:

1. **Omit needless words** - Cut ruthlessly. "The question as to whether" → "Whether"
2. **Use the active voice** - "The bug was caught by the test" → "The test caught the bug"
3. **Put statements in positive form** - "Not honest" → "Dishonest"; avoid "not un-" constructions
4. **Use definite, specific, concrete language** - Replace vague terms with precise examples
5. **Place emphatic words at the end** - Save the punch for the sentence's conclusion
6. **Express coordinate ideas in similar form** - Parallel structure aids comprehension
7. **Keep related words together** - Minimize distance between subject and verb, modifier and modified
8. **Use orthodox spelling** - Maintain credibility through correct conventions
9. **Make the paragraph the unit of composition** - One paragraph = one topic
10. **Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence** - Let readers know where they're going
11. **Use figures of speech sparingly** - Technical writing needs clarity over ornamentation
12. **Avoid a succession of loose sentences** - Vary structure to maintain engagement
13. **Do not break sentences in two** - Two weak sentences are worse than one strong sentence
14. **Avoid fancy words** - "Use" beats "utilize"; "help" beats "facilitate"
15. **Be clear** - When choosing between clarity and style, always choose clarity

**Application to technical blog posts:**
- Replace passive constructions: "is calculated by" → "calculates"
- Front-load value: Put the insight before the explanation
- Cut filler: "In order to" → "To"; "It should be noted that" → delete
- Strengthen verbs: "makes use of" → "uses"; "is in violation of" → "violates"
- Concrete examples: Not "some bugs," but "three directional bias bugs"
