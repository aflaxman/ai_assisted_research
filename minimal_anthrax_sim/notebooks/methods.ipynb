        "## Model Structure\n",
        "We developed a deterministic compartmental model to simulate the transmission of a persistent environmental pathogen in a system consisting of livestock hosts, an environmental reservoir, and scavengers. The model tracks four state variables: Susceptible Hosts ($S$), Infected Hosts ($I$), Infectious Carcasses ($C$), and Environmental Pathogen Reservoir ($E$). This framework builds upon established epidemiological models where host mortality generates infectious patches in the environment, as seen in models of anthrax transmission [1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-016-0238-1).\n"

        "Host population dynamics follow a logistic growth function with carrying capacity $K_{cap}$ and natural mortality $\\mu$. Susceptible individuals ($S$) contract the pathogen through contact with the environmental reservoir ($E$) at a transmission rate $\\beta$. Infected individuals ($I$) succumb to the disease at rate $\\alpha$ (the sum of disease-induced and natural mortality), transitioning into the Carcass state ($C$). The disease-induced mortality rate was parameterized to correspond to an average infectious period of approximately 7 days [1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-016-0238-1).\n"

The decay rate $\\kappa$ was set to $0.1$ day$^{-1}$, representing an average decay period of 10 days in the absence of scavenging [1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-016-0238-1).\n",
